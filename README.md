# Pocket Orchestra

## TODO

- [ ] MacOS drivers
- [ ] Windows drivers
- [x] Are notes passing the line below the cue? Take screencaps at the moment we register a note.
- - It feels like they're low at the cue moment.
- - Screencaps at the moment of keypress show exactly aligned where we expected (tho i'm looking at one frame ago).
- - The offset is in drivers or IO, or in your head.
- [x] Test the boundaries, how far off do you have to be to miss a note?
- - Exactly ten pixels. That's very generous but I think reasonable.
- [ ] Eliminate redundant notes from tinylamb and goatpotion
- [ ] More songs
- [x] Final waves
