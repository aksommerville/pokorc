Pocket Orchestra USB comm protocol

For use at GDEX, etc.
I want a scoreboard server that records and displays scores from multiple attached Tinies.
Figuring, they probably all need to be connected to USB anyway for charging, might as well do something fun with it.

Server should read the stream as linewise text.

EVENTS:
  score:SONGID:SCORE:MEDAL
