Pocket Orchestra font format

Small variable-width font for ASCII only.
We store 96 codepoints (0x20 thru 0x7f) in 32 bits each:
  0xc0000000 vertical start
  0x38000000 width
  0x07ffffff image LRTB big-endianly

There are 27 bits available for the image.
So 5x5 and 3x9 are fully expressible.
Anything bigger, eg 6x5 the last two pixels at bottom right must be zero.

Line height is always 9 pixels.

An all-zero glyph is treated like space: 3 pixels wide by default.

All glyphs get one pixel horizontal space between them.
