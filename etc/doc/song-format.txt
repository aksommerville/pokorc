Pocket Orchestra Song Format
It starts with MIDI, but we convert to a more digestible format at build time to save the Tiny some effort.
The song is a single stream of events, distinguishable by their first byte.
We have a hard-coded tick length: 96 Hz. This is the minimum addressable unit of time.
